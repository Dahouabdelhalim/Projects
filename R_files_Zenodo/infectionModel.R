### A simple model for disease spread with isolation probability after infection
# net: the square matrix indicating the amount of contact between two network members
# time50: the amount fo contact that results in a 50% contagion probability
# roundsBeforeRmoval: How long a network member is contagious before it is removed
# periods: how many rounds the simulation runs
# pIsolation: The probability for a network member to immediately isoalte after being infected
# is.directed: is the network directed or undirected

# example
# generate random network
randomNetwork <- matrix(floor(runif(225)*100), 15, 15)

# each element of the results list refers to the status of all network members at the end of that round
# 1 means infected, -1 means removed (i.e. infected in the past but not contagious anymore), 0 means susceptible
